# ProcessHollowing
hypervis0r's journey into process hollowing.

## Info
So basically I was looking into code injecting techniques and had heard a lot about process hollowing. Wanted to try it out for myself, while playing around a bit with Native API functions. I also tried experimenting with x64 Process Hollowing, but after doing research, I determined that I was out of my element.

## Credit
Some of the code is from [ired.team](https://github.com/mantvydasb) because I have no idea what I am doing.
